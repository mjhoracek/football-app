Hey there, thank you for checking out my football app! If you'd like to check out a demo, it's here:


https://mitch-football-app.netlify.app/


This repo is for the front end of the app, and was built with technologies including React/Next.js, Styled Components, Firebase Auth, MongoDB (mongoose), and a little Material UI

The backend server for this app is written in Express(Node.js) with the help of mongoose and firebase. 

Enjoy!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

If you'd like to clone into this repository:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
